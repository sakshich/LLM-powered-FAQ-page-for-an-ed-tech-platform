# LLM-powered-FAQ-page-for-an-ed-tech-platform
An LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. Kurated.ai is an ed-tech company and I work as a Product Manager there. Here I tried creating a LLM based system to solve all your queries about the platform.

Files:
1) main.py is streamlit application script
2) langchain_helper.py has all the langchain code
3) requirements.txt is the list of required Python packages for the project.
4) kurated_faq.csv is the CSV file of FAQs that Kurated.ai company is using right now
